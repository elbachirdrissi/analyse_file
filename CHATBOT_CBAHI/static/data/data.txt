The mission of the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI) is to continuously
improve the safety and quality of healthcare services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by supporting the healthcare
facilities to continuously comply with the accreditation standards. CBAHI does this through the provision of
preparation, on-site assessment, monitoring, education, publications and consultation services.
CBAHI is making every possible effort to separate its consultative and educational programs as well as all
publications it produces from its accreditation activities. This manual is produced for the sole use of the individual
healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals in Saudi Arabia. CBAHI provides supplementary educational
sessions to explain the intent of this manual and its contents, and therefore, attendance at these activities is
helpful in achieving compliance with the quality and safety standards followed by accreditation. Attendees at
CBAHI training, orientation and educational programs and purchasers of its publications will not have a distinctive
treatment by any CBAHI associates including CBAHI surveyors, nor receive any privilege regarding assessment
scoring results or outcome.

is the official agency authorized to grant accreditation certificates to all
governmental and private healthcare facilities operating today in Saudi Arabia.
CBAHI has emerged from the Saudi Health Council as a non-profit organization.
The principal mission of CBAHI is to set the healthcare quality and patient safety
standards against which all healthcare facilities are evaluated for evidence
of compliance. The foundation of CBAHI dated back to October 2005 as the
Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions, formed then by the
Ministerial Order Number (144187). Since then, it continued pursuing its mission
until 30-9-2013 when the Cabinet of Ministers Decree Number (371) called for
changing the name to become the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of
Healthcare Institutions, and also mandated the national accreditation by CBAHI
on all healthcare facilities. The Ministry of Health is planning to mandate CBAHI
accreditation as a future prerequisite for renewal of the operating license, a step
towards encouraging more participation in this ambitious national initiative.

The healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia is experiencing an evolution associated mainly with one of the fastest
growing rates of population in the world and a remarkable economic prosperity. This has been paralleled by
a significant and steady improvement in the overall performance of the Saudi health sector secondary to the
never-ending government support and the several quality programs and initiatives, at the forefront of which are
the accreditation programs implemented by the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions
(CBAHI), the national body responsible for setting the quality and patient safety standards and accreditation of all
types of healthcare facilities working today in Saudi Arabia.
Healthcare accreditation is gaining more reputation as a proven system for enhancing the quality and safety of care
provided to patients and their families. It also provides for a common language among healthcare professionals
especially in a country like ours where dozens of nationalities are sometimes working in one hospital, each with
a different educational and cultural background.
These benefits have encouraged most developed countries to establish their accreditation bodies, followed by
many other less developed countries. Saudi Arabia has been among the first countries to take the initiative of
establishing its own capabilities in the field of healthcare accreditation. This impetus resulted in the creation of
CBAHI several years ago. Today, CBAHI is still committed to its original mission and is currently responsible for
the assessment and accreditation of all the hospitals, primary healthcare centers, ambulatory healthcare centers,
and medical laboratories across the country. It has become evident that CBAHI is an essential guarantor of
the future of patient safety in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CBAHI is backed by its cumulative experience and
resources and before that, by the country’s sincere and committed leadership towards fulfilling the healthcare
needs of the Saudi citizens to the highest achievable quality levels.

The Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI) is proud to present this third edition
of the National Hospital Standards. Over the last few years, the health sector in Saudi Arabia has witnessed a
major advancement at all levels. One remarkable area was the great expansion in the number of hospitals and
the complexity of health care services they provide to more than twenty eight million population scattered over
more than two million square kilometers area. This comes along with a great advancement in the medical field
around the globe, with more focus on the need for hospital environments that support performance measurement
and continuous quality improvement. Here comes the rationale for national, evidence-based standards that would
support acute care hospitals in Saudi Arabia in improving the quality and safety of patient care and treatment.
Since the official inception in the late 2005, accreditation by the “Central Board“ was a voluntary program that
showed a remarkable success over the years. Lately, this has changed into a national mandatory program that is
intended to be linked with licensure in order to enhance its mission and encourage more participation of more than
four hundred hospitals operating today across the country.
During the development of this current edition of the hospital standards, one of the most important challenges
we faced was to develop standards that would apply to all acute care hospitals, considering the variation in the
quality levels across the continuum of care as we move from small hospitals in the small peripheral cities and
towns to the large tertiary medical centers in the major cities. Being departmental, detailed and prescriptive in
design and nature, this third edition of the National Hospital Standards was built to be as relevant and applicable
as possible once implemented in the relevant hospitals licensed to practice in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
As with the previous editions, the development of hospital standards aims to facilitate the process of hospital
self-assessment against preset requirements and performance expectations, ensure patient and public safety,
encourage the hospital leadership to measure the hospital performance through the use of measures and indicators,
and put emphasis on the ever-lasting concept of continuous quality improvement. This should translate ultimately
into a successful survey preparation and winning of accreditation.
Upon going through the manual, it provides important information about CBAHI, the eligibility for accreditation,
the scheduling of accreditation surveys, the survey preparation, the on-site survey, and the accreditation decision
rules. In the remaining part, one can find all the standards distributed over the twenty three chapters.
Our appreciation and gratitude goes to the committees, teams, and task forces that contributed to the development,
compilation, design, review, revision, and production of this manual. We extend our appreciation to the healthcare
professionals who were generous with their feedback and constructive comments and suggestions.
For more information on the hospital and other accreditation programs of CBAHI, as well as for all comments and
suggestions for improvement, please contact us at cbahi@cbahi.gov.sa

The Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI) is the official agency authorized to
grant healthcare accreditation to all governmental and private healthcare facilities operating today in the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia.
Originally emerged from the Saudi Health Council as a non-profit organization, CBAHI is primarily responsible for
setting the quality and safety standards to ensure a better and safer healthcare. Its initial official inauguration was
due after the Ministerial Decree number 144187/11 on October 2005 , which called for the formation of the Central
Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions that shall be responsible for the initiation of a national voluntary
healthcare accreditation program. In 1434/2013, the Council of Ministers mandated accreditation by CBAHI and
gave it its current name.
The mission of the Saudi Central Board is to promote healthcare quality and patient safety by supporting healthcare
facilities to continually comply with accreditation standards.
The vision of the Saudi Central Board is to be the regional leader in improving healthcare quality and patient
safety.
In addition to the hospital accreditation program, CBAHI now has two other accreditation programs (Primary
Healthcare Centers and Ambulatory Healthcare Centers including Medical Laboratories). Additional certification
program for blood banks and blood transfusion services is underway.
Driven by its core values and the dedicated team of surveyors and staff at the central office, CBAHI is determined
to be a major driving force and a recognized standard for the provision of safe and high quality healthcare.
CBAHI is proud to be amongst few healthcare accreditation agencies around the world that are accredited by the
International Society for Quality in Healthcare (ISQua), both standards and organization.

Healthcare accreditation:
Definition and importance
Healthcare accreditation is an assessment process that involves a rigorous, transparent, and comprehensive
evaluation by an external independent accreditation body. The health care facility undergoes an examination
of its systems, processes, and performance by peer reviewers or surveyors to ensure that all is conducted in a
manner that meets applicable predetermined and published national standards. Before the external evaluation,
i.e., the survey visit, the healthcare facility is expected to conduct a comprehensive self-assessment to decide
on the level of its preparedness and how far or how close it is from achieving full compliance with the standards.
Accreditation therefore, represents a public recognition by the health care accreditation body of the achievement
of accreditation standards by a health care facility. Standards set out a common framework to support healthcare
facilities to provide effective, timely and quality services. They are designed to deliver improved levels of care and
treatment to the citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia. There is good evidence from scientific research that shows
that engaging in a robust healthcare accreditation program improves the structure, process and outcome of care
provided by healthcare facilities. Accreditation is not simply a certificate to obtain and hang on the wall. If utilized
properly, accreditation can provide the following benefits:
Accreditation provides a framework for the organizational structure and management: almost all accreditation
standards focus on the governance and leadership structures and functions within a healthcare facility and
the appropriate management of its business and day to day activities.
Accreditation helps improve patient safety and minimize the risk of near misses, adverse outcomes, and
medical errors: ensuring patient safety through risk management and risk reduction is at the heart of all
accreditation standards and is the ultimate goal of the self-assessment and the survey activities.
Accreditation enhances community confidence in the quality and safety of care provided: when a healthcare
facility achieves accreditation, the message is clear; its leaders are committed to providing a nationally
accepted standard of care in health services delivery.
Surveyed healthcare facilities have found that seeing their own operation through the eyes of experienced
surveyors provided them with a useful, more objective assessment of their internal administrative and clinical
processes and effective proposals for further improving their processes and services to the community.
Accreditation -on the long run- proves to increase the efficiency and enhance the lean practices, which
translates into decreasing waste and more optimal results with less consumption of resources.
Achieving accreditation helps improve the competitiveness of a healthcare facility: rising public confidence
in an accredited facility will eventually encourage more patients to seek care and treatments in that facility
which will positively impact its competitiveness in the healthcare sector and increase its market share.
Achieving accreditation will satisfy the regulations of the Ministry of Health, being the legislative health authority,
which is now considering linking the national accreditation by CBAHI with the licensing of the private healthcare
facilities. Registration with CBAHI and enrollment in its national accreditation program is accepted by the Ministry
of Health -at this stage- as a satisfactory evidence for the purpose of license renewal. Eventually however, all
healthcare facilities operating in Saudi Arabia are required to achieve accreditation by CBAHI.

Reimbursement by insurers and other third parties: there is a growing tendency, nationally and internationally,
to link achieving accreditation with eligibility for insurance reimbursement.
Accreditation provides a robust tool for the continuous quality improvement efforts in the healthcare facilities:
striving relentlessly to comply with accreditation standards helps the leadership of the facility to ensure the
sustainability of the quality improvement projects and initiatives.
Accreditation provides for a great learning and educational opportunity: through staff education on the best
practices and by adding emphasis on the importance of patient education and patient rights.
Standards development process
A standard is a statement of excellence, or an explicit predetermined expectation that defines the key functions,
activities, processes and structures required for healthcare facilities to assure the provision of safe and quality
care and services.
Standards are developed by peer experts in the field and it’s against the standards that conformity of the healthcare
facility is evaluated. Simply stated, the standard describes a healthcare facility’s acceptable performance level.
Within this context, there should be no confusion between accreditation standards and licensure standards. When
applied to licensure of an individual practitioner or organization, the standard is usually set at a minimal level
designed to protect public health and safety. Accreditation standards, on the other hand, are designed as optimal
and achievable which, when met, would lead to a high quality level in a system. Broadly speaking, CBAHI standards
-as well as all other relevant accrediting agencies- are of three major types depending on which area they are
addressing. Structure standards address the system’s inputs, such as the hospital beds available, the manpower,
the design of the hospital building, the availability of personal protective equipment for health workers, such as
gloves and masks, and the availability of equipment and supplies, such as microscopes and laboratory reagents.
Process standards address the clinical and administrative activities or interventions carried out within the hospital
in the care of patients or in the management of the hospital or its staff. Examples include patient assessment,
patient education, medication administration, and alike. Outcome standards look at the assessment of the benefits
of an intervention and whether the expected purpose of the activity was achieved. They provide information
about whether predicted outcomes are being realized. Examples of outcome indicators include mortality rates,
foreign object retained after surgery, air embolism, blood incompatibility, pressure ulcers, falls, vascular catheter-
associated infection, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, and manifestations of poor glycemic control.
CBAHI standards set expectations for hospital performance that are reasonable, attainable, measurable and
therefore, surveyable. Standards were built to serve as the basis of an objective evaluation process that can help
health care facilities measure, assess and improve performance. CBAHI is striving to be a nationally recognized
symbol of excellence, respected throughout the industry and by other relevant authorities as an assurance that
accredited healthcare facilities meet rigorous standards of quality and operational integrity that emphasize consumer
protection and patient engagement. To this end, the process of standards development at CBAHI follows a long and
robust methodology to ensure that our standards are correct, evidence-based, relevant and clear. As with previous
editions, this current manual contains standards of quality and patient safety that were constructed to be descriptive
in nature and department-oriented. The first draft of CBAHI standards are developed by specialized task forces,
focus groups, and standards development committees that utilize input from a variety of sources, including:
INTRODUCTION

The standards set by the professional scientific societies, locally and internationally.
Scientific literature review and research studies.
Relevant laws, rules, and regulations.
National (or international) emerging issues related to healthcare quality and patient safety.
Input from health care professionals, providers, and patients.
Panels of experts and consensus on the so called “best practices”, given the current state of knowledge and
technology.
The process of standards development can last up to 18 months or more before an initial draft is produced. The
draft standards are then distributed nationally for review and made available for comment on the standards Field
Review page of the CBAHI website.Based on the feedback received from the field review, the draft standards
may be revised and again reviewed by the relevant experts and technical committees. The draft standards are
finally approved by the Standards Development Committee and provided to the Board for comments and remarks
before submission to the Saudi Health Council for approval. Thereafter, standards are provided in paper and
electronic formats and distributed to all hospitals and e-version is made available on CBAHI website. To comply
with the guidelines of the International Society for Quality in Healthcare (ISQua), six months period is allowed for
publishing the standards before they are effective. Once the standards are in effect, ongoing feedback is sought
for the purpose of continuous improvement.The survey process is then tailored as needed to address the new
standards, and surveyors are educated about how to assess compliance with the standards.
Accreditation Survey
CBAHI Surveyors typically employ a variety of evaluation techniques and strategies to objectively decide if the
hospital meets standards related to key systems and functions, such as governance and leadership, human
resources management, patient care processes, medication management, infection control, management and
safety of the hospital environment, and quality assurance. For example, the survey team may review written
documents (e.g., organizational bylaws, strategic and operational plans and budgets, or clinical policies and
procedures). In addition to a review of documents, surveyors will interview the hospital leaders, physicians,
nurses, employees, and patients in order to determine the hospital’s performance and compliance with standards.
For example, the surveyor might choose to interview a staff member to check on the process he or she should
go through to report a medical error that has caused harm to one of the patients receiving care in that hospital.
Similarly, a surveyor might choose to interview a patient about his or her level of satisfaction with the care
provided by the hospital. Hospital leaders, including the members of the governing body, may be interviewed
regarding the hospital’s processes and how they are designed to meet standards related to planning, budgeting,
quality assurance activities, and human resource management. Surveyors will tour the hospital’s buildings and
patient care areas in order to evaluate standards related to overall cleanliness, building safety, fire safety,
waste management, equipment and supply management, infection control, and emergency preparedness. Other
diagnostic and support services such as laboratory, radiology department, pharmacy, central sterile services
department, dietary and rehabilitation are also assessed with respect to safety, effectiveness, quality control, and
equipment management. In summary, surveyors use a variety of evaluation approaches during the on-site survey
INTRODUCTION

in order to determine the hospital’s compliance or performance with applicable structure, process, and outcome
standards. These methods might include any combination of the following:
Interviews with hospital Leadership, clinical and support staff, patient and family.
Observation of patient care and services provided.
Building tour and observation of patient care areas, building facilities, equipment management, and diagnostic
testing services.
Review of written documents such as policies and procedures, orientation and training plans and documents,
budgets, and quality assurance plans.
Review of personnel files.
Review of patients’ medical records.
Evaluation of the hospital’s achievement of specific outcome measures (e.g., hospital-acquired infection rates,
patient satisfaction) through a review and discussion of monitoring and improvement activities.
CBAHI team conducts a three-day survey unless required to be more depending on the volume and complexity of
services provided by the hospital, the number of locations or care settings included in the survey, and the type of
survey (focused or full). The scope of the survey visit includes all standards-related functions in the hospital to be
surveyed. This implies that any service/function/area that is not covered by the CBAHI hospital standards will not
be assessed during the survey visit. Applicable standards from this manual are determined by CBAHI based on the
scope of services and the decision of the onsite survey team on the specific applicability of individual standards.

Each chapter has a brief introduction that explains the chapter’s relevance and contribution to safety and quality
patient care. Each standard is composed of a stem represented by a concise statement, followed by one or
more sub-standards to clarify further the requirements of the standard. Unlike the older editions of the hospital
standards, each substandard is now constructed in a way so that to serve by itself as the evidence of compliance
that is going to be measured and scored during the on-site survey.
Broadcast on changes in this third edition of hospital
standards - Chapters, Standards and Survey Process
The CBAHI accreditation standards for hospitals underwent an extensive review based on the experience gained
over the past years. The changes in this new edition include the chapters, standards, and the survey process.
Chapter Changes
The standards related to human resources in the former “Leadership” chapter have been moved, modified, and
updated in a new separate chapter “Human Resources”. Additionally, the former chapter “Medical Staff and Provision
of Care” has been divided into two chapters: “Medical Staff”, which describes the structure and organization of the
medical staff as an entity within the hospital and “Provision of Care” that addresses the quality and safety of the
actual clinical care processes provided to patients. Moreover, the “Ambulatory Care” and the “Psychiatry” chapters
of the previous editions have been merged with the “Provision of Care” chapter to emphasize the continuum of care
from the beginning of the episode of care until patient is discharged.

standards rather than reviewing documents. The goal is to ensure that the CBAHI standards are integrated into
the daily practices of the hospital. Beside conferences, interviews, and review of documents, the major part of the
survey visit will be allocated for the evaluation of implementation of standards and the performance of the different
processes within the hospital.
Standards Changes
The 3rd edition of CBAHI hospital standards encompasses several new and revised standards for hospitals to
advance quality care and patient safety. While the changes range from minimal adjustments in some areas to
entirely new content in others, this edition maintains focus on quality care and patient safety. The standards were
updated with four goals in mind:
Develop new standards related to patient safety;
Refine existing standards;
Improve the clarity and applicability of standards; and
Update the terminology to reflect current contexts.
No matter how robust was the methodology used in building the standards, there will be always a room for
improvement. Therefore, for all comments and remarks on a standard, CBAHI website includes an electronic form
that allows hospitals, experts, and other interested parties to comment on current standards. The form allows
for constant stakeholder feedback on the standards. This is part of several other CBAHI’s initiatives to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of its internal processes, including standards development, so as to better meet
needs and expectations of our partners.
Essential Safety Requirements
Adverse events often result in a longer hospital stay, higher costs, poorer outcomes, or even death. Patient
safety has been conceptualized as the avoidance, prevention and amelioration of adverse outcomes or injuries
stemming from the processes of health care. Adverse events and medical errors are becoming major challenges
facing health authorities and accreditation agencies almost everywhere in the world. The occurrence of several
serious incidents in accredited hospitals, some of which had earned a high accreditation rating whether by CBAHI
or other international accrediting organizations, made it clear to CBAHI that compliance with the standards did
not guarantee a safe patient environment. Different strategies and tools have been introduced in this manual to
enhance patient safety and minimize the risk of adverse events. Having a patient safety program and a system
for incidents reporting are just few examples, but also the concept of Essential Safety Requirements (ESRs) that
is included in this manual.
A selected group of standards have been assigned as Essential Safety Requirements indicated in this manual
with the icon
Essential Safety Requirements are selected based on their level of risk on patients: proximity of risk, probability
of harm, severity of harm, and number of patients at risk. As the name indicates, Essential Safety Requirements

are defined as essential structures and practices -represented in this manual by a selected group of standards-
that the hospitals undergoing CBAHI accreditation must have in place and be in full compliance with, to minimize
the risk of serious harm and/or death of a patient or a staff member. The list was not meant to be all-inclusive of
essential safety requirements but rather, a focus on some areas that are relevant to our national context. ESRs are
scored similar to the old physiological principle ; the “ All or None Law “ , meaning that a standard that represents
an Essential Safety Requirement is scored during the on-site survey as a full rate or zero, depending on the level
of compliance as evidenced by documentation/interview/or observation of the surveyor. Partial compliance will
not be acceptable for any ESR and accreditation award will not be granted unless all ESRs are in full compliance.
There are (16) Essential Safety Requirements distributed in the different chapters of
this manual as follows:
HR.5 The hospital has a process for proper credentialing of staff members licensed to provide patient care.
MS.7 Medical staff members have current delineated clinical privileges.
PC.25 Policies and procedures guide the handling, use, and administration of blood and blood products.
PC.26 Patients at risk for developing venous thromboembolism are identified and managed.
QM.17 The hospital has a process to ensure correct identification of patients.
QM.18 The hospital has a process to prevent wrong patient, wrong site, and wrong surgery/procedure.
AN.2 Anesthesia staff members have the appropriate qualifications.
AN.15 Qualified staff perform moderate and deep sedation/analgesia.
IPC.4 There is a designated multidisciplinary committee that provides oversight of the infection
prevention and control program.
IPC.15 Facility design and available supplies support isolation practices.
MM.5 The hospital has a system for the safety of high-alert medications.
MM.6 The hospital has a system for the safety of look-alike and sound-alike (LASA) medications.
MM.41 The hospital has a process for monitoring, identifying, and reporting significant medication errors,
including near misses, hazardous conditions, and at-risk behaviors that have the potential to
cause patient harm.
LB.51 The blood bank develops a process to prevent disease transmission by blood/platelet transfusion.
FMS.9 The hospital ensures that all its occupants are safe from radiation hazards.
FMS.32 The hospital ensures proper maintenance of the medical gas system.

Eligibility for Accreditation
All hospitals licensed to practice in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are eligible for CBAHI accreditation. However,
eligibility for conduction of a survey visit is contingent upon fulfilling all of the following requirements:
The hospital meets all licensing requirements to operate (and therefore, has a valid license when applicable),
as indicated by the statutes and regulations of the Ministry of Health.
The hospital meets any additional licensing requirements as indicated by other relevant authorities (Most
notably, valid certificate from the Civil Defense, and any radiation-related licensing requirements from King
Abdul Aziz City for Science & Technology).
The hospital meets the legal definition of a hospital as per the regulations of the Ministry of Health and the
international guidelines in this regard :
- Licensed as a hospital under the law governing healthcare institutions in Saudi Arabia.
- Has an organized medical staff and continuous nursing services under the supervision of registered nurses.
- Maintains permanent and full time facilities that include inpatient beds for the care of overnight resident
patients, i.e. bed and board.
- Provides diagnosis (has laboratory and radiology services) and medical or surgical treatment primarily
for, but not limited to, acutely sick and injured patients. (This manual is not for facilities providing
treatment for patients with mental illness or providing treatment in special inpatient care facilities e.g.
long term care facilities).
- Provides emergency and intensive care services.
The hospital provides healthcare services addressed by the CBAHI’s National Hospital Standards.
The hospital has been in operation for at least (12) months before the on-site survey.
Effective Date of the National Hospital Standards
Manual- 3rdEdition
The effective date of this third edition of the National Hospital Standards is the first of January 2016. This is the
date after which all surveys and accreditation decisions will be based on this third edition of the National Hospital
Standards. This applies to hospitals seeking accreditation by CBAHI for the first time as well as hospitals already
accredited by CBAHI based on older editions of the hospital standards.

Registration with CBAHI
Registration with CBAHI for the purpose of accreditation is required for all eligible healthcare facilities, and is the
first step towards attaining accreditation whether for hospitals or for all other accreditation programs offered by
CBAHI.
Hospitals are required to register by completing the Healthcare Facility Registration Form located on CBAHI’s
portal. Registration is a quick, yet an important step that provides the Healthcare Accreditation Department at
CBAHI with the basic information about the registering facility. A system generated auto-reply with a code number
will be provided to the registering facility upon successful registration. The code number will be used for all future
communication with CBAHI.
Accreditation Pathway
CBAHI is committed to its mission of promoting healthcare quality and patient safety by supporting healthcare
facilities to continually comply with accreditation standards. There are several activities a healthcare facility will
go through to obtain CBAHI accreditation.
Upon successful registration, the following resources will be provided to hospitals seeking CBAHI accreditation:
National Hospital Standards
Hospital Accreditation Guide
Hospital Accreditation Guide provides all required information to help the hospital prepare for the survey visits.
It contains an abstract of each survey activity that includes logistical needs, session objectives and suggested
participants.
Each year, CBAHI decides -in accordance with its yearly operational plan- which healthcare facilities are to be
enrolled in its accreditation program for that particular year. CBAHI will notify the hospital included in its yearly
accreditation program by a letter of enrollment.
CBAHI provides ongoing Hospital Orientation Programs (HOPs) in different locations throughout the year.
Hospitals are highly encouraged to attend at one of HOPs offered by CBAHI, Although any hospital can attend, the
priority goes for hospitals selected for the current year accreditation program. During these orientation sessions,
standards, accreditation policies, and survey process are all explained in detail. This is a good opportunity for
the hospital representatives to enquire about the intent of a standard and how it will be implemented. Dates and
venues of the orientation programs will be communicated to the hospitals in a timely manner.
All hospitals enrolled in accreditation are required to conduct a comprehensive self-assessment using the Self-
Assessment Tool (SAT) provided by CBAHI. This tool is intended to support the hospital in assessing how close it is
to a satisfactory compliance with the standards and requirements. It also gives an idea of how much preparation and
time the hospital needs before it can request a survey visit. Usually, SAT is for the internal use of the healthcare facility
but it might be required by CBAHI to help deciding on the preparedness of the facility prior to conducting a survey.
Self-assessment is utilized by several other accreditation organizations to help them –if properly and objectively
conducted- to have a better insight on the baseline situation of each hospital and provides for a common
communication tool between the hospital seeking accreditation and the accrediting body. When both parties reach
a compromise about the level of preparedness for a survey visit based on the self-assessment findings, a survey
can be scheduled at a tentative date suitable for both.
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
24
Some hospitals (especially those with no prior experience in accreditation) might opt to go for A Pre-Assessment
Visit. This visit is offered by CBAHI ) subject to the availability of resources) mainly to clarify more the accreditation
policies, the standards and their intent, the survey process, the applicability of the different chapters of the
standards manual, and to assess more the position of the hospital by verifying the findings of the self-assessment.
Upon reaching a satisfactory level of compliance with all applicable standards, a mutual agreement is made
concerning the exact date of the onsite survey. Some hospitals will prefer to go for a Mock Survey but this is
subject to the availability of adequate resources at CBAHI and the requirement of its operational plans. CBAHI
therefore is not obliged to respond to all incoming mock survey requests. Other hospitals however may choose to
go for an upfront Real Survey.
Once a hospital has applied for a real survey visit and completed all the pre-survey requirements as mentioned
below, the date of the visit will depend on the scheduling availability as decided by the Healthcare Accreditation
Department at CBAHI. The date of the survey will be shared with the hospital. As a general rule, a minimum of
seven days will be allowed for hospital notification before the survey is actually conducted. When a short notice
survey is to be conducted, the hospital leadership is expected to receive the survey team and facilitate its work.
Failing to do so will subject the hospital to denial of accreditation as will be explained later.
In all cases, the following requirements are to be completed before CBAHI conducts a survey visit:
The hospital has to submit successfully a completed Survey Application Form, located on CBAHI’s portal.
Service Agreement has to be acknowledged and duly signed by the hospital and a copy is returned back to CBAHI.
Evidence of payment of the required accreditation fees.
The maximum number of real surveys a hospital is allowed to have for achieving accreditation is two (2) attempts,
within two years timeframe. Six months is the minimal time interval between two consecutive real surveys. This,
however, should not be misinterpreted as an “open-ended” exercise. For the majority of hospitals previously
accredited by CBAHI, the time interval between registration and achieving accreditation was 6-18 months on
average. Therefore, hospitals that will eventually prove to be incapable of achieving accreditation as reasonably
persuaded by CBAHI (exceeded the two years’ timeframe from the date of the first real survey without achieving
accreditation or underwent two real surveys but denied accreditation) will be suspended from participating in the
national accreditation program for 12-18 months and referred to the relevant authorities for further action.
Survey Visit / Survey Team
To earn and maintain accreditation, a hospital must undergo an on-site survey by the CBAHI survey team. The
Healthcare Accreditation Department at the central office handles all scheduling arrangements for surveys in
coordination with the healthcare facility. The date of the survey visit will be determined through a mutual agreement,
based on the capacity of CBAHI’s yearly operational plan and the satisfactory level of preparedness as evidenced
by the findings of the self-assessment.
Hospitals enrolled in the accreditation program will be notified by CBAHI to complete and submit the Survey
Application Form (SAF) available on CBAHI’s portal, indicating the type of survey requested (e.g. mock or real survey).
A survey notification letter will be sent to the hospital indicating the date of the survey and other relevant information.
The size and the specialties of the hospital survey team members are usually fixed but this might change according
to the size of the hospital and its scope of services. As mentioned before, assessing compliance is accomplished
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
25
through various survey activities and methods, such as review of documents, review of medical records and
personnel files, staff or patient interviews, and the findings observed during facility tour and units visits. Whatever
the methodology used, CBAHI survey is structured to be an intelligent search for areas of nonconformance to the
standards, rather than a check-list exercise. As a general rule, the hospital survey team is composed of seven (7)
healthcare professionals:
The Core team, composed of three surveyors: administrator, nurse, and physician.
The Specialty Team, composed of four surveyors: Pharmacist, Infection Control specialist, Laboratory
specialist, and facility management and safety specialist.
The survey is conducted under the leadership of a Survey Team Leader (Lead Surveyor) that has been designated
by CBAHI. The team leader is responsible for assuring that all survey activities are completed within the specified
time frames and according to CBAHI’s policies and survey protocols. The hospital under surveying is required
to facilitate the work of the survey team members and to allow the survey team leader to practice his role and
responsibilities which include:
Preparation and communication of the survey plan to the hospital;
Chairing the opening and closing meetings;
Communicating with hospital leadership regarding survey progress and initial findings;
Evaluating team progress and adjusting survey plans as needed;
Coordination and preparation of the survey report and submission of report to CBAHI central office.
Further details about the survey team and dynamics of the survey visit can be found in the Hospital Accreditation
Guide provided to all hospitals upon successful registration.
Rescheduling / Postponement of Surveys
Hospitals scheduled for surveys are strongly encouraged to adhere to the survey date proposed by the Healthcare
Accreditation Departmentat CBAHI. However, rescheduling or postponement may be considered for review, at the
discretion of CBAHI and on a case by case basis, only upon:
A rationale for postponement that is acceptable to CBAHI (e.g. events that will hinder the flow of the survey
process such as changes in the management team/leadership of the hospital, natural or other disasters, or
relocation of the hospital to another building).
At least (30) days advance notice (an official letter from the hospital chief executive officer indicating the
reason(s) for postponement).
Occasionally, requests for postponement (or cancellation of the survey visit) that meet the above conditions are
accepted with no penalties, and another more realistic date is selected and agreed on with the hospital, provided
this does not happen more than once during one accreditation cycle. However, requests for postponement or
cancellation that do not meet the above conditions are subject to rejection (and the survey is to be conducted) or
a “penalty charge” equal to (25%) of the required survey fee.
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
26
Accreditation Decision Rules
As a general rule, the hospital has to meet all applicable standards at an acceptable level to become accredited.
CBAHI utilizes a multilevel process for making accreditation and reaccreditation decisions. This is to ensure
fairness, consistency, objectivity, and accuracy. Towards this goal, CBAHI benefits from any relevant report and/
or significant findings or issues of concern related to the surveyed facility that were brought to attention from
relevant health authorities, past accreditation surveys, and other credible sources.
Accreditation decisions are released and communicated to the hospital within (30) days after the conclusion of the
survey visit. Accreditation decision making process is basically based on:
The findings of the survey team members as recorded in the survey report.
Discussions regarding the survey findings between the surveyor and the specialty team leader (STL).
Review of the draft report by the participating hospital for feedback or correction of any issues of fact before
making the accreditation decision.
Review/discussion during the meeting of the Accreditation Decision Committee (ADC). This committee may
request additional evidence(s) before it can make a final recommendation for an accreditation decision. All
accreditation decisions are then ratified by CBAHI Director General.
It is important to note here that the decision to grant accreditation or not is primarily based on the findings of
the on-site survey as recorded by the surveyors in the survey report. However, the numerical overall score that
the hospital attains is one important factor among others upon which the members of the Accreditation Decision
Committee rely for making their recommendation. Other factors are:
Criticality of the non-compliant standard(s), i.e. the degree of severity and immediacy of risk to patients,
visitors or staff safety.
Any concerns regarding the compliance of the hospital with the Essential Safety Requirements (ESRs) as
specified in this manual.
Criticality has several levels. The most serious of which is when the surveyor notices an immediate threat to safety
or quality of care. Examples include:
Healthcare provider is entering a contact isolation room without proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
Expired catheter is being used during central line insertion or other invasive procedure.
Bare electrical wire is hanging down without any protection.
Incompatible blood sample is sent from the operating room while the operation is in progress.
A new-born is not properly identified.
When CBAHI surveyor notices an immediate threat whether linked or not linked to the standards or the ESRs, the
survey team leader will notify the hospital director and will include the findings in the survey report. Consequently,
the hospital will receive a preliminary denial of accreditation until the issue is resolved through a Corrective Action
Plan, and possibly a follow up focused survey for verification.
It was stated before that each standard is composed of a stem statement and sub-standard(s). The sub-standard
is the evidence of compliance to be scored by the surveyor during the on-site survey. Each sub-standard has an
equal weight and is scored on a three point scale as follows:
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
27
0 = Insufficient Compliance (Less than 50% compliance with the standard).
1 = Partial Compliance (From 50% to less than 80% compliance with the standard).
2 = Satisfactory Compliance (80% and more compliance with the standard).
N/A = Not Applicable
The overall score of the hospital is calculated using the average (arithmetic mean) score of all applicable sub-
standards, i.e. as the sum of all values divided by the number of values added.
When one or more chapters of this manual are not applicable in a particular hospital, they are indicated by “N/A.”
Non applicable chapters are not scored and are not included in either the numerator or denominator of the overall
score. Full details about scoring guidelines are available in the Hospital Accreditation Guide.
The Accreditation Decision Committee shall recommend one of the following accreditation decisions:
Accredited:
Accreditation will be awarded when the surveyed hospital demonstrates an overall acceptable compliance with
all applicable standards at the time of the initial (or reaccreditation) on-site survey, and there are no issues of
concern related to the safety of patients, staff or visitors.
Accreditation will also be recommended when the healthcare facility has successfully addressed all requirements
following a conditional accreditation and does not meet any rules for other accreditation decisions. The decision
to grant accreditation is not always straightforward. In some cases though, the Accreditation Decision Committee
may consider the need for more clarification and/or a follow up focused survey of specific standards/areas of
concern or noncompliance before a consensus decision to grant accreditation can be reached. This will also give
the hospital a period of time to come into acceptable compliance.
Scoring Guidelines:
Overall score 85% or above and
All essential safety requirements are in satisfactory compliance and
No other issues of concern related to the safety of patients, visitors or staff.
Conditional Accreditation:
Conditional Accreditation is granted when the hospital demonstrates a tangible compliance with all applicable
standards at the time of the on-site survey but still has not met requirements for accredited status. The hospital
is required then to develop a “Standards Compliance Progress Report”, followed by a “follow up Focused Survey”
if required before changing the accreditation status. The non-compliant standards may include essential safety
requirements and/or other standards/issues of concern related to the safety of patients, staff or visitors.
Scoring Guidelines:
Overall score 75% or above and less than 85% and/or
Some of the essential safety requirements (but not exceeding 25% of them) are not in satisfactory compliance.
Preliminary Denial of Accreditation (PDA):
Preliminary Denial of Accreditation (PDA) is a stage -rather than a final accreditation decision- that precedes
denial of accreditation. The aim of allowing this stage is to give some additional time for review and/or appeal
before the determination to deny accreditation. It results when there is one or more of the following reasons to
justify denying accreditation:
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
28
Presence of an immediate threat to the safety of patients, visitors or staff that is observed by CBAHI surveyors
during the on-site survey.
Significant noncompliance with the accreditation standards at the time of the on-site survey.
Failure of timely submission of the post survey requirements after conditional accreditation.
The hospital has received conditional accreditation and was subjected to a follow up focused survey but still
could not meet the requirements for accreditation.
Reasonable evidence exists of fraud, plagiarism, or falsified information related to the accreditation
process. Falsification is defined as the fabrication of any information (given by verbal communication, or
paper/electronic document) provided to CBAHI by an applicant or accredited healthcare facility through
redrafting, additions, or deletions of a document content without proper attribution. Plagiarism is perceived
by CBAHI as the deliberate use of other healthcare facility original (not common-knowledge) material without
acknowledging its source. In this case, the hospital is required to respond to CBAHI by sending an official
clarification letter within five working days of the communication.
Refusal by the hospital to receive the survey team and conduct a survey. In this case, the hospital will receive
upfront denial of accreditation and will be subject for exclusion from the national accreditation program .
Denial of Accreditation:
Results when a health care facility shows a significant noncompliance with the accreditation standards at the
time of the on-site survey. It also results if one or more of the other reasons leading to preliminary denial of
accreditation have not been resolved. When the hospital is denied accreditation, it is prohibited from participating
in the accreditation program for a period of six months, unless the Director General of CBAHI, for good reason,
waives all or a portion of the waiting period.
Scoring Guidelines:
Overall score less than 75% and/or
More than 25% of the essential safety requirements are not in satisfactory compliance.
Appeal against Accreditation Decision.
A surveyed healthcare facility can appeal against the following accreditation outcomes:
Preliminary Denial of Accreditation (provided it is not due to failure of timely submission of the post survey
requirements after granting accreditation or after conditional accreditation, or due to the facility remains
conditionally accredited after a follow up focused survey).
Suspension/Revocation of Accreditation.
All appeals shall be made within maximum of (15) calendar days from receiving the official survey report, through
a covering letter sent from the chief executive officer to the CBAHI Director General via registered mail/fast courier
along with documentation to support argument for the appeal, and a completed Appeal Request Form (ARF) located
on CBAHI’s portal. Letters sent via electronic mail or facsimile will not be considered.
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
29
Grounds for appeals
The hospital is entitled for an appeal if it is based on one or more of the following grounds:
Relevant and significant information which was available to the survey team was not considered in the making
of the accreditation decision.
The report of the surveyors(s) was inconsistent with the information presented to the survey team.
Perceived bias of a surveyor(s).
Information provided by the survey team was not duly considered in the survey report.
The outcome of the appeal –if comes in favor of the appealer- will result in changing the accreditation status.
Appeals that will not result in changing the status of accreditation will not be considered by CBAHI.
Upon the initial acceptance of the appeal request (only when it is shown with clear and convincing evidence that the
hospital sustained one of the grounds for appeal), the prior status of the hospital, if any, shall be restored pending
disposition of the appeal.The appeal request shall set forth the specific grounds for the request, and shall include
a statement of the reasons for each ground, along with any other relevant statements or documents the healthcare
facility desires to include. Hospitals applying for an appeal must identify the specific alleged procedural failures
or the specific manner in which the decision was arbitrary or unreasonable and not based on, or consistent with,
CBAHI standards and policies. After studying all relevant reports and evidences, one of the following decisions
shall be made and communicated to the appealer in a timely manner:
The adverse decision is upheld, in which case the entire cost of the appeal shall be borne by the appealing
facility.
The healthcare facility’s appeal is upheld and denial of accreditation is modified or reversed. In this condition
a full or focused re-survey may be decided. In this case, the cost of the appeal shall be borne equally by the
healthcare facility and CBAHI.
Accreditation Maintenance (Post Survey Requirements)
CBAHI has redesigned its accreditation to represent a continuous process versus a once-every-three-years
evaluation. Accredited healthcare facilities are required to maintain their accreditation status by showing their
continued compliance with the standards and requirements of CBAHI throughout the accreditation cycle and in
accordance with the specified time frames. This translates into standing and Ad Hoc requirements.
Standing Requirements for Accreditation Maintenance
Corrective Action Plan (CAP)
When accreditation is awarded to a hospital, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) addressing all standards that were
not in satisfactory compliance during the on-site survey should be received for review and acceptance within
(120) days from the date of the accreditation decision. The CAP ideally focuses on demonstrating what has been
done rather than what will be done. The CAP should identify all non-compliant standards, the requirements for
improvement, the corrective actions that have been taken or will be taken with dates and responsible individuals,
and as applicable,the monitoring measures to ensure sustainability of the actions taken. A delay in the submission
of the CAP that exceeds (30) days beyond the due date without justification might result in temporary suspension
of the accreditation certificate.
Standards Compliance Progress Report (SPR)
When a hospital is conditionally accredited, it is expected to maintain this “transitional” status until fulfilling
the requirements for an accredited status. Therefore, the hospital is required to address all ESRs and other
1
2
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
30
standards and issues of concern that were not in satisfactory compliance during the on-site survey in a
Standards Compliance Progress Report (SPR). The SPR should be received for review and acceptance by the
relevant department at CBAHI within (60) days from the date of the accreditation decision. There are cases
where the SPR is going to be reviewed and accreditation decision made on that basis. In other cases, the
hospital compliance is going to be validated through a follow up focused survey within (30) days from the date
of receiving the SPR. Successful compliance with the standards after the follow up focused survey will result
in changing the conditional accreditation to accredited status. When the hospital fails to submit the SPR as
required or still does not meet the conditions for accreditation after the follow up focused survey, it will enter
into a Preliminary Denial stage .
Midterm Self-Assessment
Accredited hospitals are required to participate in a mid-cycle self-evaluation of standards compliance (Midterm
Self-Assessment). Fifteen months from the date of accreditation awarding, the hospital should start utilizing the
self-assessment tool to assist in the periodic review of its performance against the standards. The hospital then
has (3) months to complete the assessment.
Completion of the midterm assessment will allow the hospital to identify areas of non-compliance with the
standards and therefore, to set a plan for correction of deficient areas and come into compliance before the next
on-site survey.
For those areas self-identified as non-compliant with CBAHI standards, the hospital will submit a Corrective Action
Plan to CBAHI that includes evidence(s) to substantiate that the standard has been brought into compliance. The
relevant department at CBAHI will review each hospital’s plan of action via a telephone interview and will indicate
whether the action plan and timetables are acceptable to bring the standard into compliance.
During the next on-site visit following submission of the mid-term assessment, the surveyor will look for the
evidences of compliance/correction that the hospital provided as part of the plan of action.
When there is a legitimate concern about the safety and quality of services provided by an accredited hospital at
the time of the mid-term assessment, CBAHI may require the hospital to undergo a mid-cycle survey, (a fee will be
charged to cover costs) and to submit a plan of action for areas of non-compliance.
A delay in submitting the mid-term assessment by more than (60) days from the due date without a justification
acceptable to CBAHI may result in temporary suspension of accreditation, followed by revocation of accreditation
if the total delay exceeds (90) days.
Ad Hoc Requirements for Accreditation Maintenance
Reporting of a sentinel event
It is not rare to see a sentinel event occurring in an accredited facility. When it occurs, it must be reported to CBAHI
within (5) working days of the internal notification of the event. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) with a risk reduction
action plan must then be submitted to CBAHI within (30) working days (see more about how and why to report a
sentinel event in the Policy on Sentinel Events).
Notification of significant changes
Accredited hospitals must notify CBAHI in writing about any significant structural/functional/regulatory changes
that took place after the accreditation survey, no more than (30) days of the initiation/occurrence of such changes,
which include, but are not limited to, the following:
The Ministry of Health has revoked the operating license and/or has mandated closure for all or part of the hospital.
The hospital is not in compliance anymore with other relevant rules and regulations (e.g., Civil Defense license
or license related to radiation handling and safety have been withdrawn).
3

2
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
31
Hospital accreditation by other international accrediting organizations has been suspended or revoked.
A new service is initiated for which CBAHI has standards and was not included in the last survey.
The hospital has a new location or a new branch.
Major construction/destruction/renovation work.
Significant increase (or decrease) in the volume of services/bed capacity.
Merge with or acquisition of an unaccredited facility.
Significant change in the governance or ownership.
The impact of these changes will be evaluated by relevant departments in CBAHI and a decision for conducting a
For-Purpose Survey may be warranted accordingly.
A delay in notifying CBAHI of such significant changes occurring in an accredited facility by more than (60) days
from the due date without a justification acceptable to CBAHI may result in temporary suspension of accreditation,
followed by revocation of accreditation if the total delay exceeds (90) days.
Sentinel Events
Thousands of patients all over the world die every year because of serious incidents happening to them while
receiving care inside hospitals. CBAHI and all other healthcare accreditation organizations have one purpose in
common: contribute to improved quality, safety and experience of healthcare services through systems that are
patient/family-centered, provide for early identification and review of near misses and reportable events, and
ensure lessons are learnt so preventable adverse events are not repeated.
Sentinel Events (SE) are relatively infrequent but they do occur. Simply defined, a sentinel event is any event
leading to serious patient harm or death and is caused by healthcare rather than the patient’s underlying illness.
By investigating sentinel events, we can identify deficiencies in healthcare systems and processes, and put
actions in place to prevent recurrence.
The Ministry of Health has identified the following events as must-to report events:
Unexpected death
Maternal death
Wrong patient, wrong procedure, or wrong site.
Retained instrument or sponge
Medication error leading to death or major morbidity
Infant abduction or infant discharged to the wrong family
Unexpected loss of a limb or a function
Hemolytic blood transfusion reaction
Inpatient suicide
Gas embolism
The policy of CBAHI on sentinel events calls for the following:
Open disclosure/open communication: patients and their families are entitled at all times to truthful and
transparent communication and explanation of any sentinel events happening to them.
A distinction has to be made, both at the hospital and the national level, between a sentinel event occurring
because of a pure negligence from the healthcare practitioner or a criminal act or a deliberate unsafe act, and
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
32
another sentinel event occurring because of an underlying system failure. The former is dealt with by a special
process that may involve the relevant authorities. However, for sentinel events occurring due to a system
failure, individual healthcare practitioners are not held accountable for system failures and a just culture
prevails. CBAHI always encourages blame free non -punitive environment and it is the prime responsibility of
the hospital leadership and the heads of the departments to establish this culture of openness and disclosure
in their work place, otherwise “you cannot fix that which you are unaware of !”.
When a reportable sentinel event occurs in a hospital accredited by CBAHI, it must be reported to CBAHI
as indicated in the timeframe below. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities that are not accredited by
CBAHI are encouraged -but not required- to report. Besides reporting, CBAHI may become aware of the
occurrence of a sentinel event by one of CBAHI's surveyors, from the media, from a patient or a relative, from
the healthcare facility's employee or through other means of communication.
CBAHI is interested to know about reportable sentinel events when they occur in accredited facilities for
the purpose of learning and dissemination of lessons learnt to the medical community so that to avoid any
recurrence of such events in the future. Medical errors and adverse events are opportunities for education
and quality improvements (educate the young and regulate the old !).
Reporting must be safe. Patients, families and staff are encouraged -and should be empowered by the hospital
leadership- to report any sentinel event without fear of retribution. CBAHI has zero tolerance for accredited
hospitals taking disciplinary actions against a staff member who reported a sentinel event. If the disciplinary
action proves to be related to reporting, this might negatively impact the accreditation status of the hospital.
Starting from January 2016, hospitals accredited by CBAHI must report to CBAHI all sentinel events by filling
up and submitting the Sentinel Event Reporting Form (SERF) found on CBAHI portal, within (5) working days of
the internal notification of the sentinel event (the date when the relevant authority in the hospital was notified
of the incident). This should be followed by a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Risk Reduction Action Plan
within (30) working days from the date of notification of the sentinel event. Root Cause Analysis is a formal
process of investigation designed to identify the root causes of adverse events.
CBAHI will study the sentinel event report for further action as appropriate. This includes the submission of
a progress report to show the progress made in implementing the risk reduction plan and eliminating the
chance of recurrence, but it might also include a validating focused survey-scheduled or unannounced- at
the discretion of the relevant department at CBAHI.
The final outcome of a reported sentinel event is dependent on the level of commitment demonstrated by the
hospital towards studying the root cause(s) of the incident and re-designing its processes and systems to
prevent future recurrence. When CBAHI is persuaded of this constructive approach of the concerned hospital
in dealing with sentinel events, accreditation is usually maintained. When this is not the case, CBAHI will
pursue this further to decide on the eligibility of the hospital to maintain versus suspend its accreditation until
the required corrections are made. In some other situations when the validity of the accreditation certificate is
less than (6) months and CBAHI is not enough persuaded of the corrections made, an early full re-accreditation
survey might be warranted.
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES

Accreditation Suspension and Revocation
CBAHI expects nothing but truth, honesty, and sincere intentions in all dealings and propositions from healthcare
facilities engaged in its accreditation program. This "good faith” engagement applies continuously throughout
the accreditation cycle, and the healthcare facility must ensure that it is not violated at all times. In addition,
accredited hospitals are expected to keep the same momentum before and after granted accreditation. Some
might argue that it is a natural tendency to “relax” after a survey visit, but it is not acceptable that the compliance
with the standards drops simply because the survey is over and accreditation is awarded. If CBAHI became aware
by any mean of an accredited hospital that is not in compliance with the standards, this will be verified and an
appropriate action will be taken accordingly.
CBAHI may receive information regarding possible violations from accredited healthcare facilities through several
channels; most importantly reports of related government agencies, written or verbal complaints and media.
Types of violation include, but are not limited to, the following:
CBAHI becomes aware of the presence of an immediate threat to the safety of patients or staff in an accredited
hospital.
The hospital is not committed to the specified timeframes for accreditation maintenance (e.g., timely submission
of corrective action plan after granting accreditation or timely submission of midterm self-assessment).
The hospital failed to report a sentinel event as per the relevant policy without an acceptable justification.
The hospital is committing an act of misuse (see the policy on accreditation certificate and seal), deception,
or any deliberate misrepresentation of the truth (see the policy on truthfulness and ethics clause).
The hospital is discouraging communication or taking disciplinary action/reprisal against patients or staff
members trying to communicate directly with CBAHI for concerns about safety or quality of care.
The hospital is intentionally lacking commitment towards the continuous compliance with CBAHI standards.
This might represent an overweening behavior and is a strong violation of the CBAHI accreditation process.
The hospital is deliberately violating any of the other accreditation policies mentioned in this manual or in
other supporting documents and manuals provided by CBAHI for the purpose of accreditation.
Once CBAHI is persuaded about one or more of the aforementioned violations in an accredited hospital, it usually
responds by taking one of the following actions in any order:
Issuing a letter of “At Risk of Suspension of Accreditation”.
Suspension of Accreditation.
Revocation of Accreditation.
CBAHI decides the level of response to a certain violation based on several factors including the severity of
the violation, its frequency, the previous accreditation history, the source of information regarding the violation,
and findings and conclusion of CBAHI's enquiry. Whenever deemed necessary, a focused or a full survey might
be conducted for validation before a response or action can be made. This kind of “Discretionary surveys” is
always for one or more of the above causes (e.g., when concerns have been raised about an accredited hospital's
continued compliance with CBAHI Standards). An accredited hospital may undergo a discretionary survey at any
time, at the discretion of CBAHI, and the survey is usually unscheduled (the hospital receives 48 hours’ notice
before it is conducted) or unannounced (without advance notice) depending on the seriousness and type of the
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
34
violation. Again, surveys can include either all of a hospital’s services or only those areas where a serious concern
may exist. Hospitals are usually charged for these surveys, regardless of the outcome, and results can affect the
hospital accreditation status. If the hospital does not allow CBAHI surveyors to conduct the survey, CBAHI may
change the hospital’s status to Revocation of Accreditation.
It should be noted that when the hospital accreditation is suspended, the hospital can regain accreditation once
the causative violation has been rectified, but suspension will not be lifted before a prohibition period of (12)
months from the date of suspension.
The revocation of accreditation is a more serious complication that prohibits participation in CBAHI accreditation
program for minimum of (18) months from the date of revoke. In both suspension and revocation of accreditation,
CBAHI will communicate the new accreditation decision with the relevant authorities and will display it on its
website. The Director General of CBAHI, for good reason, can waive all or a portion of the prohibition period.
Random Surveys
To support CBAHI's ongoing quality assurance initiatives, an accredited hospital may be selected for a random
survey from (9) to (30) months after an accreditation survey. Random surveys are unannounced. Five per cent
sample of all accredited hospitals is randomly selected each year for this activity. These unannounced surveys,
which are usually conducted by 2-3 surveyors but could be full surveys, are a means by which CBAHI can evaluate
the consistency and quality of its program, while also demonstrating to the public and regulators that accredited
hospitals remain committed to CBAHI standards throughout the accreditation cycle. Random surveys also provide
CBAHI and its surveyors with opportunities to further consult with accredited hospitals in the interval between
regular surveys. No fee shall be charged to the hospital when a random survey is conducted.
Accreditation Certificate and Seal
Once accreditation is granted, healthcare facilities are encouraged to display CBAHI logo, accreditation certificate
and seal on the facility bulletin boards, banners, website, newsletters, brochures, and headed stationery denoting
their accreditation status.
CBAHI requires all accredited healthcare facilities to follow the guidelines and conditions for the appropriate use
of the CBAHI logo, accreditation certificate and seal. Specifically, CBAHI works to ensure that no accreditation
material be used in a way which may mislead the public or others or provide false information related to the
accreditation status of a healthcare facility.
Upon receiving the certificate package, accredited hospitals are required to sign and return back a disclaimer/
guidelines form related to the conditions of display and publication of CBAHI logo, accreditation certificate and
seal, which include:
Ensuring that printing of the accreditation seal is accurate and legible with no degradation or distortion.
The size of CBAHI logo and its accreditation seal should remain in the same permitted proportion as provided.
The CBAHI logo, certificate, and seal should be used in the same format, with avoidance of adding any extra
graphics or words.
The hospital abides by the same colors used in CBAHI logo or black and white, when being used for certain
printed materials such as newspaper advertisements, newsletters, brochures, flyers and posters.
The hospital is prohibited from the use of CBAHI logo or accreditation seal on business cards.
Upon expiry of the certificate validity period, or suspension/revocation of the accreditation, the hospital shall
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
35
immediately take actions within maximum of (30) days to refrain from using the CBAHI logo, accreditation
certificate and seal. Failure to comply with the specified time frame might subject the hospital to the appropriate
decision according to the policy on accreditation suspension and revocation.
Release of Accreditation-Related Confidential Information
CBAHI acknowledges that hospitals undergoing its accreditation survey are expected to provide access to
information related to the evaluation of their conformance to the CBAHI standards.
As a guiding policy, CBAHI commits to healthcare facilities engaged in its different accreditation programs that
all information obtained or received during the accreditation process will be kept confidential, including all survey
data and information that surveyors come across during the survey process.
For a hospital that is a participating member of the CBAHI accreditation program, some information is subject to
public release, which includes:
The hospital accreditation status being posted on CBAHI website.
The areas of the hospital which were included in the accreditation survey.
The standards under which the accreditation survey was conducted.
Other accreditation-related information is not subject to public release except to the hospital on question. The
exception to this rule is when CBAHI receives an official request for clarification from relevant health authorities
or public health agencies. Information includes:
The mock and final accreditation survey reports.
Accreditation Committee minutes and agenda materials.
The notification letter of the survey report to the hospital director.
The accreditation certificate.
The post-survey requirements including any CAPs or SPRs.
The result of investigations related to a sentinel event including the root cause analysis prepared in response
to that event.
The result of investigations involving any falsified information provided to CBAHI by the hospital.
Any other information related to compliance with CBAHI standards that is obtained from the hospital before,
during, or following the accreditation survey.
Complaints against Accredited Hospital
CBAHI is interested to collect information from a variety of sources to improve the quality and safety in all accredited
hospitals. One of these sources is complaints from patients, their families, the hospital staff, government agencies,
media and the public. In particular, staff members at any given hospital accredited by CBAHI must be informed that
they may make a complaint directly to CBAHI without fear of retaliatory actions from their hospital.
CBAHI addresses all complaints that would help identify possible noncompliance with its accreditation standards,
and consequently, a possible threat to the safety of patients, staff, or public. To be more precise, CBAHI can only
evaluate complaint information in terms of its relevance to compliance with its standards. Issues of personal
nature or individual disputes should be dealt with by the concerned facility or the regional health authority. CBAHI
also cannot follow up on complaints about hospitals that it does not accredit.
ACCREDITATION
POLICIES
36
When a complaint against accredited hospital is received by CBAHI, it will undergo an initial screening to decide on
its relation to standards and its impact on patient safety. If it does not relate to compliance with CBAHI standards,
a response of “non-relevance” will be forwarded to the complainant and will be advised to forward the complaint
to the hospital leadership or the regional health authority. If the complaint relates to compliance with one or more of
CBAHI standards, a specific response shall be taken accordingly. The response will depend on a risk assessment
matrix to decide on the probability and severity components.We also check for other complaints about the same
hospital. Broadly speaking, CBAHI will take one or both of the following responses:
CBAHI may write to the hospital about the complaint received and the hospital is required to make available,
when requested, its records of complaints and subsequent action taken.
CBAHI may decide to visit the hospital to verify if there is a problem in meeting the standards that deal with the
complainant’s concern. Such visits are usually unannounced and the outcome may change the accreditation
decision.
It is the policy of CBAHI not to disclose any information related to patients or complainants unless authorized to
do so. Besides the information given to the complainant about the relevance of the complaint to CBAHI standards,
the complainant will be provided with the following information:
The course of action taken by CBAHI regarding the complaint.
Whether CBAHI has decided to take action regarding hospital’s accreditation decision following completion
of the complaint investigation.
To file a complaint against a hospital accredited by CBAHI, an individual can send his concern via the contact
form on CBAHI website. The other way is to file the complaint directly by calling the Universal Access Number
920012512.
CBAHI requires the identity of the complainer. Therefore, anonymous complaints will not be considered.
Conflict of Interest
CBAHI works to ensure the integrity and fairness of all businesses run by the employees working in the central
office as well as the surveyors.
In addition, all healthcare facilities engaged in CBAHI accreditation process are required to refrain from any actual
or potential act or behavior that might create a conflict of interest including:
Proposing any fee, remuneration, gift, or gratuity of any value to CBAHI employees or surveyors for
performance of their duties or survey-related activities.
Employing or contracting or having any financial relationship with CBAHI employees or surveyors for the
purpose of the provision of consulting or related services in any capacity, either directly or through another
party. This includes services provides in preparation for the survey, assisting in preparation of the self-
assessment, conducting mock surveys, helping in the interpretation of the standards, and alike. All requests
for consulting services utilizing one of CBAHI associates shall be directed to CBAHI central office.
Not declaring to CBAHI any business (including consulting) or recruiting relationship with one or more of
CBAHI surveyors either directly or through another party with whom he or she is affiliated, at any time during
the preceding three (3) years.

Truthfulness and Ethics Clause
CBAHI strives to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of its business. This includes
being honest, transparent, and truthful in all its dealings, with avoidance of all situations that might give even the
impression of being unethical or illegal. The same is expected from the hospitals going for accreditation by CBAHI.
CBAHI employees are committed to politely declining any gifts or gratuities offered to them or to a member of their
family including spouses, children, and parents when the donor expects something in return, may be attempting
to gain an unfair advantage, or influence the manner in which the associate performs his/her job duties. Gifts of
nominal value may be accepted as tokens of appreciation or goodwill providing that they are given as a gesture
of a professional relationship and do not involve or create the appearance of any commitment towards the survey
results or accreditation decisions.
Business lunch, tea, coffee, and snacks during the survey are permitted. Other social gatherings are prohibited
and hospitals are encouraged not to offer such to the survey team. Transporting the survey team by the hospital
vehicle to and from the survey site is acceptable.
CBAHI’s confidential and proprietary business information are safeguarded and utilized only in keeping with
the best interests of CBAHI, its obligations to third parties, and the highest ethical and legal standards. Such
information is not be disclosed to a third party without prior approval of a duly authorized member of CBAHI
management upon an acceptable reason.
CBAHI maintains the confidentiality of all data and information of both CBAHI and healthcare facilities in
accordance with CBAHI's core values and relevant policies.
CBAHI is also committed to resolve complaints and ethical issues raised by CBAHI employees or client hospitals
in order to ensure justice, confidentiality, impartiality, timeliness, and feedback to the complainant.

LEADERSHIP (LD)
For any hospital, quality and patient safety depend on effective leadership. It is important for all hospitals to
have a clearly stated mission and vision, and it is the responsibility of the leadership of the hospital to develop
the appropriate mission and vision and provide adequate resources to fulfill them. The leadership must come
from the governing body and the executive management including the hospital director, the medical director, the
nursing director, the administrators, and the heads of departments, with the governing body being the ultimate
responsible for the quality and safety of health care services provided by the hospital. To ensure quality and safe
care, the members of the leadership group must work collaboratively, communicate effectively through clear lines
of authority, and coordinate and integrate all services provided.
Hospitals may vary in size, type of ownership, and complexity of services. Every hospital regardless of the
complexity and scope of service has a governing body which might represents the Ministry of Health or its
directorates, other governmental entities or a private owner. A large hospital tends to have a multi-member
governing body that is ultimately accountable for the operation and performance of the hospital. In smaller
hospitals, these responsibilities may be handled by just one or two individuals.
This chapter addresses the roles and responsibilities of the leadership group for several processes, the examples
of which are:
Hospital mission, vision, and values
Organizational structure
Development and promotion of professional ethical conduct
Formulation and construction of the strategic plan
Planning and designing services and structures
Processes for collaboration, coordination, and communication
Financial management
Contracts oversight
The responsibilities of the governing body

Human Resources (HR)
In order for the hospital to provide a quality and safe care, improving the human resources practices and
management is critical. In this twenty first century, it is not acceptable any more for a hospital to operate without
an efficient human resources department directed by a qualified director who understands the contemporary
practices for managing people in a complex setting like the healthcare industry.
Recognizing the human resources challenges and the best strategies to follow should be on the top list of the
hospital management. This chapter is newly added to this manual to emphasize the importance of a successful
human resources management in any hospital or healthcare organization trying to compete for a better care and
more market share.
This chapter discusses the standards related to the following functions of the human resources management:
Attraction of qualified staff
Orientation of new staff

Medical Staff (MS)
A hospital's medical staff, the group of physicians and dentists licensed to practice medicine and prescribe
medications, plays a critical role in assuring quality care and improving patients' outcomes in the hospital. The
standards in this chapter define the medical staff leaders’ roles and responsibilities in credentialing, privileging,
bylaws development, committees and departments’ management, as well as performance improvement.
A good hospital should always have a clear structure of its medical staff, including departments, divisions, and
medical committees. The medical director is responsible for the organization and conduct of the medical staff, and
is viewed as the critical link between the governing board, the hospital director, and the medical staff. The medical
director must be a physician and must have his or her duties clearly defined in writing.
Important processes and activities addressed in this chapter include the following:
Medical staff leaders’ roles and responsibilities
Medical staff evaluation, credentialing and privileging
Medical staff committees
Medical staff bylaws
Medical staff collaboration with other disciplines

STANDARDS
Provision of Care (PC)
Hospitals vary in the scope of services they provide and thus the types of patients they may effectively serve. The
hospital should accept patients for care according to its capability to provide the services that meet the identified
patient’s needs.
Providing optimum care requires careful planning, coordination, and communication. The hospital must provide
an appropriate and thorough assessment of each patient, and patient care must be planned and implemented to
ensure the best possible outcome. To support the continuity of care, patient assessment and care process must
be documented in a completed medical record that is unique for each and every patient. As the care process may
need to be provided by multiple providers, a collaborative process should be in place to promote continuity and
coordination of care when the patient is referred, transferred, or discharged.
Important processes and activities addressed in this chapter include the following:
Screening of patients before acceptance for care
Access to care
Registration and admission processes
Scope and content of patient assessment and reassessment
Plans of care
Continuity and coordination of care
Consultations
High risk and vulnerable patients
Psychiatric patients
Patient discharge, transfer and referral within or outside the organization

STANDARDS
Nursing Care (NR)
The Nursing Director is considered a member of the hospital leadership. His/her role is essential in achieving high
quality patient care. The Nursing Director is responsible and accountable for the standard of nursing care in the
hospital along with the Medical Director and Quality Director. All should work as one team to monitor and observe
the standards of clinical care provided to patients all over the hospital. The Nursing Director and other nurse
Managers together with the nursing staff and nursing aides are the cornerstone for the provision of a high quality
and safe care for several reasons, the most obvious of which is that the nursing staff members are the closest to
the patients because of their roles and responsibilities. Medical staff members are also essential for quality and
safe care but they do not spend the same amount of time besides patients like the nurses do.
Nurses have the responsibility to ensure that quality standards are adhered to in order to minimize risk and provide
safe care to all patients. A major role is expected from the nursing staff in almost all aspects of the quality program
and competent nursing structure is expected to participate fully in the implementation of the quality standards.
This chapter defines the important processes required by the nursing department, such as:
Nursing department organization
Nursing department staffing
The role of the nursing director
Collaboration with other departments/committees

Quality Management
and Patient Safety (QM)
This chapter addresses the senior leaders and the hospital staff's responsibility towards implementing programs
that effectively improve quality and safety and reduce risks to patients, staff and visitors. The hospital leadership
plays an essential role in ensuring the provision of the resources required and clearing the direction towards
achieving this goal. When the hospital leaders are themselves involved and encourage and support everyone
in the organization to be involved in the quality management initiatives, a general atmosphere of confidence
and inspiration to work harder and to achieve high quality of care and maximum degree of safety is established.
Leadership, therefore, has to set up a planned and ongoing program where processes and systems are the focus
of the improvement, not only individuals.
To be able to effectively improve quality and safety of care and reduce risks, the hospital must constantly use
indicators to measure its performance and use the resulting information to identify processes which can be improved.
The hospital must also be able to identify significant unexpected or adverse events and intensively analyze them
to understand their underlying causes and, as a result, make the necessary improvement interventions.
This chapter defines the processes required to improve quality and safety and reduce risks as follows:
A planned and organization wide approach for quality improvement
The required structure (quality and patient safety committee)
The quality management department
The quality management program
Leadership and other staff quality concepts education
Data collection for structure, process and outcome indicators of quality
Prioritization and implementation of appropriate improvements
Risk management
Identification and analysis of significant events
Patient safety program
Incidents reporting and management

Although anesthesia is necessary for many procedures, it is important to acknowledge that undergoing anesthesia
is not a simple procedure. Patients can have adverse reactions to the anesthesia drugs administered before,
during and after surgery. Despite the potential hazards, anesthesia can be relatively safe if proper standards
are followed. To decrease the likelihood of anesthesia related complications, the standards in this chapter were
designed to address pre-anesthetic assessment performed prior to the administration of sedation or anesthetic;
patient monitoring during and after surgery until appropriate recovery; and anesthetic supplies and equipment.
Additionally, the standards require that staff be trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to ensure the
availability of a trained staff during normal hours of operation.

Labor and Delivery (L&D)
Most women have normal conception, fetal growth, labor, and birth and require minimal-to-no intervention in
the process. Despite this fact, there is a considerable number of pregnant women who present to the hospital
seeking help for different reasons, particularly upon the end of their pregnancies. Even in the most developed
healthcare systems, labor rooms are considered high risk areas where significant morbidities and mortalities
occur for various causes, most of which are preventable if the quality and safety standards were adhered to. In
this modern era of medicine, deliveries should be conducted in a safe environment by qualified physicians, nurses
and midwives who have been granted privileges to provide such services in accordance with the organization’s
license and scope of services.

immediate examination and treatment. The hospital must provide emergency services by setting up an emergency
room that is well staffed and equipped. The emergency room services should be organized to provide optimum
care for patients in a safe, appropriate, efficient, effective, responsive and caring manner. Emergency services
should be directed and coordinated in a collaborative manner.
A reliable and consistent triage system performed by qualified staff should be established and used to assess all
patients on arrival. It is essential that the patient’s problems are assessed and the appropriate treatment arranged
taking into account the degree of urgency and clinical condition of the patient. For all patients, documentation
should be detailed, accurate, professional and maintained.

Medication Management (MM)
Medication management is an important part of the preventive, curative and palliative treatment of many diseases
and conditions that are dealt with by healthcare professionals in hospitals. Medication safety is becoming a priority
in all safety programs because the magnitude of harm that can be caused by wrong medication or wrong dose is
great and many sentinel events occurring in hospitals today are actually medications-related. To eliminate any
potential harm that could be caused by medications, hospitals need to develop their own medication management
systems that fulfill two important components: effectiveness and safety.
This chapter outlines the requirements for the following processes and activities related to medication management:
Staff planning and qualifications
Staff education
Selection and procuring of medications
Storage
Ordering
Preparing and dispensing
Administration
Monitoring and evaluation
